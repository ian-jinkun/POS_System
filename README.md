# POS_System
**This project mainly uses Java program to realize the business logic of POS system, and provides a visual UI interface for Users.**

Users can search the items they need through the UI interface, and they can add and trade the items. It can also display a list of items selected by the user and the total price. As users trade items, the system will reduce the inventory of items accordingly. If the current number of items is zero, the user cannot trade. The system supports transactions by multiple users.
